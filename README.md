# AI Brain Tumor Detection

This is a deep learning-powered **AI Brain Tumor Detection** web app using **Flask**.  
Users can upload brain MRI images and the system predicts whether there is a tumor or not using a **ResNet50 model**.

## Features

- Upload MRI images via a web interface
- Deep learning model predicts **Tumor** or **Normal**
- Shows prediction confidence and progress bar
- Modern, responsive UI
- Flask + Keras + TensorFlow backend


### Note: The trained model file (`brain_tumor_resnet50.h5`) is **not included** due to GitHub size limits.
